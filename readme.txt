Computer Component Program

Description
This C++ program simulates computer components, specifically CPU and RAM. It demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and display of CPU and RAM information.

Features
-   Creates CPU objects with clock speed and core count.
-   Creates RAM objects with memory capacity.
-   Allows setting and retrieving CPU and RAM properties.
-   Displays CPU and RAM information.

Code Structure
The code consists of several files:
-   main.cpp: Contains the main function with the program logic to create and interact with CPU and RAM objects.
-   cpu.h: Contains the declaration of the `CPU` class.
-   cpu.cpp: Contains the implementation of the `CPU` class member functions.
-   ram.h: Contains the declaration of the `RAM` class.
-   ram.cpp: Contains the implementation of the `RAM` class member functions.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling CPU clock speeds and data.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the code in the respective files (main.cpp, cpu.h, cpu.cpp, ram.h, and ram.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
